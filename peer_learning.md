### 3. Theaters

* **query11():** This function performs an aggregation query on the "theaters" collection to group the data by the city field in the location.address subdocument, count the number of documents in each group, sort the result in descending order of the count, and return only the top 10 results.<br>
* **query12():** This function performs a geospatial aggregation query using the $geoNear operator to find the documents in the "theaters" collection that are closest to a specified location, which is represented by a longitude-latitude pair.<br>

### 4. Movies

* **query11(n):** This function takes an integer n as input and returns the top n movies with highest IMDb ratings. It queries the MongoDB database myDB and sorts the movies by their imdb.rating field in descending order.

* **query21():** This function returns the number of movies directed by each director in the database. It queries the MongoDB database myDB, groups the movies by their directors field using $unwind and $group operators, and sorts the results by the count of movies for each director.
* **query22(year):** This function takes an integer year as input and returns the director who directed the most movies in that year. It queries the MongoDB database myDB, filters the movies by their year field, groups the movies by their directors field using $unwind and $group operators, and finds the director with the highest count of movies.
